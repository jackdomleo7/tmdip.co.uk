            <li>
              Ensure all our vehicles are replaced at economic intervals and

        <li>
          Sustainable Strategy: To achieve this, as a company we will strive to
          integrate sustainability into all aspects of what we do. This will be
          considered from the advice we give to clients - to our considerations
          for resourcing of materials for installations - from being a great
          place to work - to minimising our own environmental impact.

        <li>
          Emergency Planning:
          <p>
            In the event of an environmental accident at site it is imperative
            that a plan of action is available to prevent and mitigate against
            any environmental impact. The aspects that have been identified as
            possibly leading to environmental situation include unplanned
            asbestos release; existing site contamination; spillages including
            fuel or substances used on site. The size and scale of environmental
            incidents will or may vary from site to site. It may be possible
            that any smaller spillage and leaks can be cleared in a controlled
            manner by site operatives. Considerations must be taken for the use
            of external contractors/emergency teams where any incident has
            exceeded the clear up limits of an individual.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Action:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Once the manager/supervisor/responsible person as been notified of
              any potential or actual environmental incident the following
              action must be taken.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evacuate the area where the incident as occurred.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take reasonable steps /actions to prevent where possible the
              spread of further contamination.
            </li>
            <li>
              Secure the area and prevent access to the best of their ability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Protect where possible escape of contaminants into any nearby
              water courses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notify anyone nearby who may also be affected.
            </li>
